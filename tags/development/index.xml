      <description>EDCON2019 EDCON 2019 kicked off, in Sydney Australia, with a pleasantly surprising ice breaker. Vitalik Buterin, Karl Floersch and Co. captured the audience with a live on-stage hip-hop performance; waxing lyrical about eth2.0, merkle proofs, plasma chains, zkSNARKs, eWASM and account abstraction.
The upbeat and playful community atmosphere continued throughout the entire conference. The days were not only filled with conference presentations. They were filled with lively community interactions, the sharing of ideas, collaborative coding opportunities and even physical puzzle challenges.</description>
