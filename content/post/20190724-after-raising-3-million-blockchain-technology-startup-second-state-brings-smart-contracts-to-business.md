[The Second State BUIDL tool](https://buidl.secondstate.io/), a browser-based IDE, allows developers to quickly write, build and deploy all elements of a decentralized application (“DApp”), including smart contracts, formal rules, web3 scripts, ElasticSearch scripts, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. [BUIDL](https://buidl.secondstate.io/) works with all Second State blockchains, as well as Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

The Second State blockchain is fully compatible with the Ethereum platform, but with its own enterprise-friendly virtual machine and [programming language extensions](https://www.litylang.org/). Notable examples of such enterprise features include: 

* A [formal rules engine and rules language](https://www.litylang.org/business_rules/ in smart contracts 
* An integrated [smart contract search engine services](https://github.com/second-state/smart-contract-search-engine) to complement web3
* A high-performance and fast-finality underlying blockchain
* A one-second confirmation time
* Gas-free operations

**A new blockchain you can create with the click of a mouse**

With comprehensive DevOps and container tools, Second State empowers customers to [create a new blockchain simply and easily](http://baas-mvp.secondstate.io/). Each newly-created Second State blockchain is ready for [mart contract search](https://github.com/second-state/smart-contract-search-engine), data services, and [BUIDL](https://buidl.secondstate.io/).

Second State engages the [open source](https://github.com/second-state) developer community to develop and promote the software stack, and then curate turn-key solutions for specific industries. Its subscription-based service offerings include software support and updates, production deployment and management, training and more.

Dr. Yuan, who authored [Building Blockchain Applications](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0135172322/) (published by Addison-Wesley), brings extensive experience developing and commercializing open source and decentralized software to the Second State enterprise. Moreover, Second State’s contribution to the open source community already has been [acknowledged by Ethereum developers](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/06/25/solidity-storage-array-bugs/), crediting Second State’s own Ming Chuan Lin "for both discovering and fixing the bug." 

Moving forward, Second State aims to make major contributions to the new WebAssembly-based Ethereum 2.0 virtual machine. For more information about Second State, visit [secondstate.io](http://secondstate.io/).
