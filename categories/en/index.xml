      <description>Learn Ethereum development and acquire complex technical concepts in a snap!
Second State Inc is to release Ethereum development A2Z series articles to help you learn Ethereum in a short time starting from the basics, with real blockchain development cases.
This article is to introduce Smart Contract ABI, the first piece in the series.
Blockchain Smart Contract ABI is the interface between smart contracts and blockchain applications. After a smart contract is compiled into a binary file by a compiler like BUIDL, an ABI for this smart contract is automatically generated, recording the functions and parameters of the smart contract.</description>

      <description>Halloween is finally here! Are you ready for the spookiest night of the year?
BUIDL IDE tools now has an upgraded UI just for Halloween. Trick or treat! A spooky pumpkin on the top welcomes you to the BUIDL’s Halloween.
Now, for developers, can you tell what the following code is for?
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  pragma lity ^1.2.4; contract Halloween { function greet() pure public returns (string) { return &amp;#34;Happy Halloween&amp;#34;; } }   This is a very simple (yet spooky) smart contract example, just like the “Hello World” on the internet.</description>

      <description>Ethereum is a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language. It allows anyone to create a decentralised application, by making use of Ethereum smart contracts.
 “The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the part of Ethereum that handles smart contract deployment and execution” (Antonopoulos and Wood, 2018).
 The EVM consists of a stack-based architecture. In order for a smart contract to be deployed, all high level Ethereum smart contract code must first be compiled into machine-readable code (called bytecode).</description>
